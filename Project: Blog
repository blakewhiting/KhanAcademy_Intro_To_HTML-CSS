            I get the car today to work. Good old 09 Santa Fe. Has it's problems, but it works. Plan on getting a new transmission soon because it is quite sluggish now. Need new calipers, brakes (I can do that myself), timing chain is gonna need a replacement, and the suspension needs to be replaced. It does have 200,000km on it, so it is time to replace a lot of the parts. That's my plan for the next few months.<br>

            It's been a year since my last post. This has been a useless blog. Oh well, here's another useless post. I got a new sound system. I now use a DiGiCo SD10 for my console, I bought 12 RCF HDL20-A loudspeakers, and 6 RCF SUB-9007-AS dual 21" subs. I also filled my Mic rac with 18 Sennheiser EW500-g4 systems. Not cheap. Also got a new truck. I put everything in my trailer and tow it with my new Nissan Titan. <br>

            It has been another year, and now I have definetly proven to myself that this blog is useless. I now own a bigger trailer for some new gear. I got some truss, and some new lights, and some Fast-Fold screens, and even 2 Christie Projectors. I ended up with 16 used Robe Mega-Pointe lights, and 8 Martin Mac Aura-XD lights. If anyone has some used ETC Colorsource CYC lights, I would buy 8. That's all. See ya.<br>
