    Hello everyone, I would like to bring to your     attention that there may just be a hidden         metaphor for Communism in everyone's favorite     racing game, Mario Kart Wii. <br></p>
    
    <h3><em>My</em> Story from this dark place on the         Internet</h3>
    <p>
    As an avid Mario Kart player, I can say that I     have endured my fair-shares of blue shells.        However, after representing Uzbekistan in the      2009 Central Uzbek Nintendo Tournament (CUNT), and receiving at least 69 blue shell attacks,  I finally come to the conclusion that the blue     shell is not just any ordinary in-game item,     but in fact a metaphor for Communism.<br>
</p>

<h3><em>Why</em> Do I <em>know</em> that Mario-Kart is communist?</h3>

<p>
Think about it. The entire game can be seen as a microcosm for Capitalism. The players that place in the top six gain the most experience, and they receive upbeat and cheerful music after every race, which could represent the privileges 1%. Meanwhile, the players that place below the top six will in fact lose experience, and degrading and sad music will be played after they finish the race. The players below the top six will have to work their way up to the top in order to receive the benefits of the top six. See? A perfect representation of Capitalism! <br></p>
<h3>What did I find in my travels that is communist propaganda?</h3>
<p>
There is an item that can be used to disrupt the course of the race; the blue shell. Any player that is not in first can receive this item upon opening up a item box. Said item will track down the player in first, and hit them without failure. Thus giving all the players that are not in first an opportunity to catch up during the race, and therefore equalizing the playing field. Did Nintendo mean to include this? We may never know. I believe that the blue shell is supposed to be a metaphor for Communism, as it can allow those below 6th place (the 1%) to catch up and be equal to those in 6th place and above (the 1%).<br>
